# This file is not referenced from the k8s kustomization.yaml file in this git repo path
# It is added only to be able to apply changes and related git commits that do not
# change the HelmRelease object's spec and so do not trigger any HelmRelease reconciliation
# (so not new revisions of the Helm release are created by flux2 helm-controller)
#
# Add whatever you want here below (for git to detect differences with previoys version)

This is the first added message !
